# Stock Analysis

Stock Analysis will take a list of given stock tickers plus a given time period as input, 
then output multiple trendliens based on historical data.  As well as graph the stocks against each other based on: 
Price to Earnings, Price to Sales, Return on Equity, and Debt to Equity.

Stock Analysis also saves all pulled data in timestamped folders in a folder called graphs that is automatically created in the same directory as the program.
